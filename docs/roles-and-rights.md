# Roles & rights (R&R) — who can see and do what

Single reference for ATSIQ's permission model. Every claim here is enforced **server-side**
in `src/lib/*.functions.ts` / `src/lib/auth.middleware.ts` — the sidebar/menu visibility
(`src/hooks/useNavCtx.ts`, `src/components/nav-config.ts`) only mirrors it.

## The model

- **Account owner** — the creator of the organisation (`org_members.is_owner`). Passes every
  role check (`assertRole`/`requireRole` semantics, auth.middleware.ts:54/111). Transferable,
  not grantable to two people.
- **Five grantable roles** (`AppRole`): `recruiter`, `hiring_manager`, `department_head`,
  `hr_head`, `president_cbo`. A member can hold several; a member with **no roles gets the
  recruiter (TA) journey**.
- **Platform super admin** — separate, cross-tenant (platform console / AI usage only).
- **Golden rule:** reads are **organisation-wide** — every active member can *see* the org's
  requisitions, JDs, candidates (incl. CV text), applications, scores, interviews, screening
  and offers. Roles gate **actions**, not reads. Two read exceptions below (HR performance,
  ROI).

## Actions matrix (server-enforced)

### Requisitions & JD
| Action | Who |
|---|---|
| Create requisition / draft JD / edit JD / import JD | any member |
| Send to Department Head (→ `pending_dh`) | any member |
| Approve as Department Head (→ `pending_hr`) | `department_head` |
| Approve as HR Head (→ `pending_cbo`) | `hr_head` |
| Final approval (→ `approved`) | `president_cbo` |
| Reject a pending requisition | `department_head`, `hr_head` or `president_cbo` |
| Put on hold / close | `hr_head` or `president_cbo` |
| Approve a JD (`jd_status → approved`) | `department_head`, `hr_head` or `president_cbo` |

(requisitions.functions.ts `REQ_TRANSITIONS`:28-47; assertRole at :76; JD approval :280-296)

### Pipeline — matching, screening, candidates
| Action | Who |
|---|---|
| Run JD↔CV matching / AI screening / view score evidence | any member (org-gated); hiring managers & department heads see the matching results for their requisitions |
| Prepare / edit / grade a screening kit; upload CVs; add candidates; attach pool candidates | any member (org-gated) |
| Delete candidates | `hr_head` or `president_cbo` |

### Interviews & stage moves
| Action | Who |
|---|---|
| Schedule / reschedule an interview | any member (reschedule needs a reason) |
| Submit a scorecard | the assigned evaluator (locks on submit) |
| Move a candidate through applied → ai_screened → shortlisted → L1 → L2 → L3 | any member (legal transitions only; reasons required on closes) |
| Move into the offer pipeline (`offer_pending/released/accepted`) or `joined` | `hr_head` or `president_cbo` |

(lifecycle.functions.ts:13-20,58-65; interviews.functions.ts:33,209-216)

### Offers
| Action | Who |
|---|---|
| Raise an offer (lands at `pending_hr`, candidate parked at `offer_pending`) | `recruiter`, `hr_head` or `president_cbo` |
| HR approval (→ `pending_cbo`) — requires the offer letter first | `hr_head` |
| CBO approval (→ `approved`) | `president_cbo` |
| Release (→ `released`) — requires pre-onboarding documents validated | `hr_head` |
| Revoke a released/accepted offer | `hr_head` or `president_cbo` |

(offers.functions.ts `OFFER_TRANSITIONS`:31-42, assertRole :121; create gate at the top of createOffer)

### Users, roles & settings
| Action | Who |
|---|---|
| Invite members, grant/revoke roles, disable/remove members | **owner or `president_cbo`** only (`assertAdmin`, org.functions.ts:410-431); cannot act on owners or yourself |
| Organisation settings, archive organisation | owner |
| Transfer ownership | owner |

### Integrations & platform
| Action | Who |
|---|---|
| Save/test integration credentials, rotate webhooks | `hr_head` (owner passes) |
| Platform console, cross-org AI usage, impersonation-free super admin | platform super admin |
| Candidate emails / HRMS / board / inbox configuration | follows the integrations + settings rules above |

### Read exceptions (the only role-filtered reads)
- **HR team performance** — owner, `president_cbo`, `hr_head` only (hr-performance.functions.ts:51-57).
- **ROI** — nav-gated to leadership; server check covers membership + cross-org (see hardening notes).

## Hardening notes

Enforcement tightened 2026-10-01 (previously org-gated): **offer creation** (now recruiter /
hr_head / president_cbo), **candidate deletion** (now hr_head / president_cbo). Verified
already-correct: **ROI** was server-gated to owner / president_cbo / hr_head all along
(roi.functions.ts:112-120). Matching and screening remain org-gated on purpose — the whole
hiring team works them; hiring managers and department heads get the matching view without
the sourcing tools (pool, screening, offers, inbox).
