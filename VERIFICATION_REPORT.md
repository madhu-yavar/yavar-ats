# Verification Report — ATSIQ release validation

**Current release date:** 2026-09-22  
**Architecture under test:** PostgreSQL + Drizzle, first-party cookie sessions, S3-compatible private storage and organisation-owned AI credentials.  
**Status:** RELEASE BLOCKED. On 2026-09-22 at approximately 22:13 UTC, the integration test was invoked without the required disposable database override and its cleanup targeted the configured remote database. The run was stopped after the cleanup failed during fixture creation. No publication is permitted until point-in-time recovery is completed and data counts are reconciled.

## Release incident and containment

- Pre-test known business counts: 73 candidates, 33 requisitions and 80 applications.
- Immediate post-incident counts: 0 candidates, 0 requisitions and 0 applications; the interrupted fixture left 2 test organisations and 2 test users.
- Containment: release work and publishing stopped; no further stateful checks are permitted against the affected database.
- Prevention: the destructive integration suite now rejects every database hostname except `127.0.0.1`, `localhost` and `::1` before its cleanup statement.
- Recovery requirement: restore the database to the latest point immediately before 2026-09-22 22:13 UTC, then reconcile organisation, membership, user, candidate, requisition, application, offer, interview and audit counts before resuming release validation.

## F. Browser-layer round (P2-browser, second verification pass)

Multi-row social-profile upserts use the real unique-index conflict target; JD versioning computed org-scoped server-side.

## Deployment notes discovered during testing

1. **postgres.js does not accept libpq-style `?host=/tmp` URL params** — it forwards them as startup parameters and Postgres rejects them (`unrecognized configuration parameter "host"`). Client deployments must use plain TCP URLs (`postgresql://user@host:5432/db`) — goes in the P6 deployment guide.
2. `drizzle/pg-migrations` emits a benign identifier-truncation NOTICE for the long `integration_credentials` FK name — cosmetic.

## Current architecture confirmation

- Browser business-data reads and mutations use TanStack server functions backed by Drizzle and PostgreSQL.
- Sign-in uses first-party password verification and a database-backed `atsiq_session` HttpOnly cookie.
- Tenant operations use organisation middleware plus explicit `orgId` query predicates; PostgreSQL row-level security is not treated as the application boundary.
- AI work requires the active organisation's encrypted Gemini, OpenAI or Claude credential. No platform key is substituted.
- Privileged role, tenant and credential changes write to the central audit log.
- The labelled `test_roi_cohort` contains 50 accepted-offer application records created only to validate RoI analytics; it is excluded from claims about production hiring outcomes.

## Environment-dependent checks

- Live AI quality and quota behaviour require a test organisation's own provider key.
- Sending email, creating Google Meet/Microsoft Teams/Zoom meetings, and LinkedIn/Naukri/Indeed operations require valid provider approvals and credentials.
- Destructive organisation, membership, offer and merge scenarios run only against a disposable database fixture.
- The in-process rate limiter is instance-local; a shared limiter is required before horizontally scaling public write traffic.

## Historical migration evidence

The checks above sections A–F are retained as the migration baseline from 2026-09-12. References there to pending P2–P6 work describe that historical test round and are superseded by the current architecture confirmation in this report.

## Addendum — 2026-09-28 verification round (AI usage ledger, vendor abstraction, candidate emails, password policy)

Scope: the 2026-09-27/28 feature set — candidate email outbox (11c13e7), enterprise password policy (6ff14c4), AI usage ledger + platform AI-usage console + vendor/model abstraction (df1139c). This round was run against the disposable local stack (`scripts/local-e2e/local-dev.sh`: PostgreSQL on 127.0.0.1:54333, dev server on 127.0.0.1:8080) and does not lift the release-blocked status above, which remains tied to the 2026-09-22 production-data incident.

| C1  | In-app manual refreshed: Integrations described as four tabs (Candidate sources, Interview meetings, Candidate emails, AI model) with a candidate-email toggles step; password-policy step added to sign-in/recovery | ✅ PASS |

Known limits of this round:

- Live token harvesting (`include_usage` for OpenAI, Anthropic `message_start`/`message_delta` frames, Gemini `usageMetadata`) was not exercised against real provider keys — the local fixture has none. The code paths are typed, unit of truth is the gateway, and the no-key path correctly logs nothing. First production run with a valid organisation key should confirm non-zero token counts per provider in `/platform-ai-usage`.
