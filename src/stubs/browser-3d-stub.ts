/**
 * Server-side stub for the browser-only 3D stack (three, three-spritetext,
 * react-force-graph-3d). Those packages read `window.THREE` while they are being
 * evaluated, so when the server bundler pulled them in, every server-rendered
 * page crashed with "window is not defined".
 *
 * The 3D view is only ever rendered in the browser (lazy import in
 * src/routes/brain.tsx), so the server can safely resolve these packages to this
 * inert module — nothing here is ever called during server rendering.
